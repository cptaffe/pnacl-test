pnacl-test
==========

This repo is a page that loads a pNaCl module. It takes input, if that input is a number, it ouputs a list of all primes between it and zero.

The bit that does the prime generation is some code I wrote that uses a linked list to store a list of primes generated using the Seive of Atkin. It is not very memory efficient, which is why I chose it for testing out chrome. Crashing stuff is always fun.
